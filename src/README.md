**Rules:**
Connect four is a very simple gameServer. It is always played between 2 players and on a 7x6 space board.
Each turn, each player chooses a column to place his piece, it drops down to the first available square.
The one who manages to place 4 consecutive pieces in a row horizontally, vertical or diagonal wins.
If no one succeeds, the match ends in a draw.

**History:**
This gameServer is centuries old, Captain James Cook used to play it with his fellow officers on his long voyages,
and so it has also been called "Captain's Mistress".
Milton Bradley (now owned by Hasbro) published a version of this gameServer called "Connect Four" in 1974.
Other names for this gameServer are "Four-in-a-Row" and "Plot Four".

**Project overview:**
This one-week Project was completed within 7 weeks of bootcamp, mixing the learned concepts of Concurrency and Network Programming.
We were told to choose one text-based game, that should be usable by multiple users that will connect to it over the network.
To be able to play, the user should run the "GameLauncher" as a server, and connect 2 users using "Player".
